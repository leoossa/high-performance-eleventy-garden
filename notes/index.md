# About these Notes

This veeery long text was generated with [Postmodernism Generator](https://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/) [^Wiki] just to present you options with [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/).
Take a closer look at [highlighted part](#highlight) - it is animated when it's visible on the screen, and re-animated each time it appears on the screen. The animation is slow to present you that specific feature. 

1. Narratives of absurdity
The main theme of the works of Pynchon is the rubicon, and some would say
the genre, of capitalist sexual identity. If postconstructivist
deconstructivism holds, the works of Pynchon are reminiscent of Koons.

In a sense, Scuglia implies that we have to choose
between Debordist image and cultural narrative. The creation/destruction
distinction which is a central theme of Fellini’s La Dolce Vita is also
evident in Satyricon, although in a more self-sufficient sense.

It could be said that Baudrillard uses the term ‘neosemanticist structural
theory’ to denote a mythopoetical totality. If Foucaultist power relations
holds, we have to choose between Debordist image and predeconstructivist
feminism.

In a sense, the primary theme of la Tournier’s essay
on Lyotardist narrative is not theory, as Foucaultist power relations suggests,
but pretheory. Bataille promotes the use of Debordist image to analyse and read
sexual identity.

[2. Foucaultist power relations and neomaterial cultural theory
In the works of Fellini, a predominant concept is the distinction between
closing and opening. Therefore, in La Dolce Vita, Fellini examines
capitalist desublimation; in Amarcord, however, he reiterates the
subtextual paradigm of reality. Scuglia holds that we
have to choose between Foucaultist power relations and dialectic sublimation.]{.box}

However, Derrida uses the term ‘neomaterial cultural theory’ to denote the
bridge between class and society. The subject is contextualised into a
Foucaultist power relations that includes art as a whole.

But [several]{.underline} theories concerning capitalist desublimation may be revealed.
The main theme of the works of Fellini is the meaninglessness, and subsequent
absurdity, of subtextual sexual identity.

3. Fellini and neomaterial cultural theory
“Class is fundamentally meaningless,” says Lyotard; however, according to
Hanfkopf , it is not so much class that is fundamentally
meaningless, but rather the futility, and hence the meaninglessness, of class.
However, the collapse, and some would say the economy, of the capitalist
paradigm of consensus depicted in Madonna’s Erotica emerges again in
Material Girl. Foucault’s model of Foucaultist power relations implies
that the task of the reader is [social]{.circle} comment.


[If one examines neomaterial cultural theory, one is faced with a choice:
either accept capitalist desublimation or conclude that culture serves to
reinforce outdated, sexist perceptions of consciousness, but only if sexuality
is distinct from truth; otherwise, the raison d’etre of the participant is
significant form. But the subject is interpolated into a Foucaultist power
relations that includes sexuality as a reality. A number of discourses
concerning a postconstructive totality exist.]{#highlight}

The primary theme of la Fournier’s essay on
neopatriarchialist textual theory is the role of the writer as participant.
However, capitalist desublimation holds that sexual identity has significance,
given that the premise of Foucaultist power relations is valid. Baudrillard
suggests the use of capitalist desublimation to challenge class divisions.

But many deappropriations concerning neomaterial cultural theory may be
discovered. Lyotard’s analysis of subdeconstructive nationalism suggests that
the goal of the poet is social comment.

In a sense, Sontag uses the term ‘capitalist desublimation’ to denote not
discourse, but prediscourse. In Erotica, Madonna denies neomaterial
cultural theory; in Sex she examines cultural construction.

Therefore, Derrida promotes the use of neomaterial cultural theory to modify
society. The example of capitalist desublimation prevalent in Madonna’s
Erotica is also evident in Sex, although in a more mythopoetical
sense.

Thus, Lyotard suggests the use of neocapitalist theory to attack the status
quo. The premise of neomaterial cultural theory holds that language is used to
oppress the Other.

4. Narratives of failure
If one examines Sartreist existentialism, one is faced with a choice: either
reject capitalist desublimation or conclude that the collective is used in the
service of capitalism. It could be said that the subject is contextualised into
a Foucaultist power relations that includes narrativity as a whole. An
abundance of situationisms concerning the common ground between class and
sexual identity exist.

“Culture is part of the meaninglessness of truth,” says Bataille; however,
according to Prinn, it is not so much culture that is
part of the meaninglessness of truth, but rather the economy, and eventually
the defining characteristic, of culture. In a sense, Marx promotes the use of
neomaterial cultural theory to read and modify class. A number of discourses
concerning poststructural conceptualism may be revealed.

But the subject is interpolated into a Foucaultist power relations that
includes truth as a paradox. Bataille uses the term ‘neomaterial cultural
theory’ to denote a self-referential reality.

In a sense, several narratives concerning the economy, and some would say
the genre, of capitalist society exist. Lyotard’s essay on Baudrillardist
hyperreality suggests that discourse is created by communication, but only if
culture is equal to consciousness; if that is not the case, Lacan’s model of
Foucaultist power relations is one of “neostructural dialectic theory”, and
therefore impossible.

Thus, if capitalist desublimation holds, we have to choose between
neomaterial cultural theory and subcapitalist feminism. Bataille uses the term
‘Foucaultist power relations’ to denote a mythopoetical totality.

In a sense, Sontag suggests the use of the material paradigm of context to
challenge archaic perceptions of sexual identity. The premise of Foucaultist
power relations states that class, ironically, has objective value.
